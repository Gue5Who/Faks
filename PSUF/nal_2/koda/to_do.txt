🧩 What you need to do (step-by-step)
1️⃣ Explore the dataset

Load a few spectra using numpy.loadtxt (like in the PDF).

Plot them (matplotlib) vs. wavelength.

Identify a few spectra that look very different — visually or using a metric (e.g. Euclidean distance from mean).

These will be your “reference examples” later.

2️⃣ Implement PCA manually

Write your own PCA code:

Center the data by subtracting the mean of each wavelength bin.

Compute covariance matrix.

Get eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Sort by descending eigenvalue.

Project data into q dimensions.

Attach this code as plain text in your final report.

3️⃣ Visualize PCA results

Plot the spectra projected into the first 2 or 3 PCA components.

Mark the previously identified “outlier” spectra in this projection.

Optionally color points by physical parameters (Teff, [M/H], log g).

4️⃣ Determine dimensionality

Compute cumulative variance explained by eigenvalues.

Plot variance fraction vs. number of components.

Find how many components explain ≥90% of total variance.

Discuss what physical quantity (temperature, metallicity, etc.) drives the main variance.

5️⃣ Analyze structure in PCA space

Check whether clusters correspond to specific types (MAB, BIN, etc.).

Describe any patterns (e.g. high-Teff stars cluster together).

6️⃣ Try kernel PCA (optional comparison)

Use sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA.

Compare its separation ability to your manual PCA.

7️⃣ Apply t-SNE

Use sklearn.manifold.TSNE.

Reduce to 2D.

Vary parameters (perplexity, learning_rate, n_iter) and note how clustering changes.

Visualize results — each point = one spectrum.

Identify groups that match your reference spectra.

8️⃣ Identify new groups

Find any “extra” clusters that don’t match given categories.

Try to interpret them physically (e.g. emission strength, double lines, broadened Hα).

9️⃣ Special analysis – emission-line stars

Run t-SNE excluding the wavelength region around Hα (≈6555–6575 Å).

See how emission stars (HAE) behave — do they still form distinct clusters?

🔟 Optional (+ bonus)

Use DBSCAN to automatically find clusters in the 2D t-SNE projection.

Try different parameters:
eps (cluster radius) and min_samples (minimum cluster size).

Assign cluster names (not numbers).

Save a classification file for all spectra:
